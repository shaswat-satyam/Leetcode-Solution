# Contribution Guide for LeetCode API

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the LeetCode API project! Your contributions will help us build a comprehensive solution database. Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## Guidelines

1. **Language Restrictions**  
   We only accept solutions in `C++` and `Java`. Contributions in any other language will not be merged.

2. **Filename Format**  
   Please adhere to the following filename structure:  
   `questionNumber_questionTopic_languageExtension`  
   For example, for the problem "Two Sum" (question number 1), the filename should be:  
   `0001_two-sum_cpp`  
   Make sure to pad the question number to 4 digits.

3. **Commit Policy**  
   Please commit only **one file at a time** to keep the history clear and manageable.

4. **Duplicate Solutions**  
   Before submitting a pull request (PR), ensure that there is no existing solution for the problem. If a solution already exists, do not submit a PR.

5. **Submission Process**  
   Submit your solution on LeetCode first and ensure it is valid. Only then should you create a PR for the solution.

Thank you for your contributions! Together, we can build a robust resource for LeetCode solutions.
